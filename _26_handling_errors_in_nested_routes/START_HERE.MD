# What I learn here ?

- one can get more granular handling if error when using nested route error component
- the higher `error.tsx` file is positioned in the hierarchy, the more UI get blocked by the error handler
- the deeper `error.tsx` file is positioned in the hierarchy, the less UI get blocked by the error handler
- the position of `error.tsx` determines the scope of error handling
- see `diapo_*.png` for more details
